# Unlocking the Power of Agentic Coding

Training materials for engineering teams learning to use agentic coding tools like **Claude Code** and **Cursor** effectively.

## What's in here

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [self-assessment-rubric.md](self-assessment-rubric.md) | Figure out which track to start with |
| [foundational-concepts.md](foundational-concepts.md) | Core mental models everyone should read first |
| [vibe-coding-book-summary.md](vibe-coding-book-summary.md) | Key takeaways from *Vibe Coding* by Yegge & Kim |
| [exercises-track-1-building-the-mental-model.md](exercises-track-1-building-the-mental-model.md) | Exercises for engineers new to AI coding tools |
| [exercises-track-2-autocomplete-to-delegation.md](exercises-track-2-autocomplete-to-delegation.md) | Exercises for Copilot users moving to agentic workflows |
| [exercises-track-3-sharpening-the-edge.md](exercises-track-3-sharpening-the-edge.md) | Exercises for engineers already using agentic tools |

The `exercises/` folder contains starter C# files and test data for each track's hands-on exercises.

## How to use this

1. **Read [foundational-concepts.md](foundational-concepts.md)** (~15 minutes). This covers the shared mental models that make everything else click.
2. **Take the [self-assessment](self-assessment-rubric.md)** to find your starting track. If you're between two tracks, start with the lower one.
3. **Work through your track's exercises.** Each track has 2-3 exercises that progress from a self-contained warm-up to real-codebase tasks.
4. **Move to the next track when you're ready.** There's no timeline.

## The three tracks

- **Track 1 — Building the Mental Model:** For engineers with no or minimal AI coding experience. Build intuition for what these tools do, how to interact with them, and when to trust the output.
- **Track 2 — From Autocomplete to Delegation:** For engineers who use Copilot but haven't done agentic work. Learn the shift from line-by-line suggestions to delegating multi-step tasks.
- **Track 3 — Sharpening the Edge:** For engineers already using agentic tools who want consistent, repeatable results. Focus on test-driven workflows, planning, and full workflow integration.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** and/or **Cursor** installed
- Code examples use **C#** and **.NET**
